Mino is a minimal object language.

The purpose of this project is to illustrate the construction of a
small interpreter and a small compiler for an object language.

The lexer and parser are built using sablecc-4-beta.2.

HOW TO COMPILE
==============

In order to compile Mino, you must first compile the grammar files.

java -jar path-to-sablecc-4-beta.2/lib/sablecc.jar -d src -p mino grammar/mino.sablecc

Once this is done, you can compile the java files, in the src/
directory, as you would normally.

An Eclipse project file has been included so that you can easily
import the project into Eclipse and compile it there.

On Windows, replace all the "/" above by "\".

Have fun!
