Mino is a minimal object language.

The purpose of this project is to illustrate the construction of a
small interpreter and a small compiler for an object language.

The lexer is built using sablecc-4-beta.x and the parser/AST using
sablecc-3.2.

HOW TO COMPILE
==============

In order to compile Mino, you must first compile the grammar files. It
is important to compile the lexer grammar (sablecc4) last, as it will
overwrite lexer files generated from the parser grammar (sablecc3).

java -jar path-to-sablecc-3.2/lib/sablecc.jar -d src/ grammar/mino.sablecc3
java -jar path-to-sablecc-4-beta.x/lib/sablecc.jar -t sablecc3 -d src/ -p mino.syntax grammar/mino.sablecc

Once this is done, you can compile the java files, in the src/
directory, as you would normally.

An Eclipse project file has been included so that you can easily
import the project into Eclipse and compile it there.

On Windows, replace all the "/" above by "\".

Have fun!
